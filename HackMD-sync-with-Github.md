Down in the lower left corner, select the option for a template (I chose **Try it!**). This loads the template with a bunch of boilerplate language.

## Create Github repo (or use existing) 

To sync this with Github, I also created a repo called, **hackmd-notes**

In the **Options**, I selected the **Versions and Github Sync**,

I was asked about switching line endings, which I selected **Switch Now**.

The next window gives the following options:

I want to **Push to Github**, and the next dialogue box displays the repositories, but first I need to authorize HackMD on Github. Click on the **Authorize more repos**,

This opens a new window in the browser and asks which repos I want to add,

I chose the mjfrigaard account, and click **Install & Authorize**. When this is done, we are redirected back to HackMD and we can see the account linked under **Integration**.

Back in my HackMD window, I **Refresh** the list of repos and select the `hackmd-notes` from the list. In the other dropdown boxes, I had to type in `master` and `README.md`

I create a version and add a description, then click **Push**. Now when I head back over to the repo, I see the HackMD file has been pushed,
